- Real-time fraud score computation for transactions
- Preprocessed dataset generation and synthetic fraud data support
- Trained machine learning model with auto-retraining pipeline
- REST API for logging transactions and querying predictions
- Comprehensive model evaluation and monitoring
- Database integration for transaction history
- JWT-based authentication for API security

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.10+, Flask
